# SWFT Application Design

## Mission Objectives
- Summarise the programme goals, target accreditation levels, and key success metrics.
- Capture stakeholder personas, decision cadence, and reporting expectations.

## System Overview
- Diagram how source control, CI/CD, evidence storage, and runtime environments connect.
- Identify trust boundaries, data flows, and security controls on each boundary.

## Evidence Catalogue
- Describe how SBOM, Trivy, and run manifests are produced, signed, stored, and promoted.
- Note retention policies, encryption posture, and access governance.

## Control Mapping
- Map compliance frameworks (NIST 800-53, DoD SRG, etc.) to pipeline stages and artefacts.
- Document inherited controls vs. implementation-specific evidence.

## Operational Playbooks
- Outline responder procedures for failed runs, critical CVEs, and policy drift.
- Provide escalation contacts and SLA targets.

## Architecture Decisions
- Track major technology decisions, risks, and mitigation strategies.
- Link to ADRs or external design documentation when relevant.
